⏺ I'll explain the concept of hash maps and then we can
  explore how they're implemented in your codebase!

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Hash maps are one of the most powerful data structures
  in programming, offering O(1) average-case lookup time
  by using a hash function to convert keys into array
  indices. They're the backbone of many higher-level data
   structures and algorithms.

  Hash Map Concept

  A hash map (also called hash table or dictionary) is a
  data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides
   very fast access to values based on their keys.

  Core Components:

  1. Hash Function: Converts keys into array indices
    - Takes any key (string, number, object) → produces
  an integer index
    - Should distribute keys evenly across the array
    - Same key always produces same hash
  2. Bucket Array: The underlying storage
    - Fixed-size array where data is actually stored
    - Each index is called a "bucket"
  3. Collision Handling: What happens when different keys
   hash to same index
    - Chaining: Store multiple items in linked lists at
  each bucket
    - Open Addressing: Find next available slot (linear
  probing, etc.)

  How It Works:

  Key "john" → hash("john") = 42 → array[42] = "John's
  data"
  Key "mary" → hash("mary") = 17 → array[17] = "Mary's
  data"

  Time Complexity:

  - Average case: O(1) for insert, delete, lookup
  - Worst case: O(n) if all keys hash to same bucket

  Let me examine your hash map implementation to see how
  these concepts are applied:

⏺ Perfect! Your codebase shows a hash map implementation
  in progress. Let me explain how your current code
  demonstrates the hash map concepts:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Your implementation uses a polynomial rolling hash with
   prime number 31 (common in Java's String.hashCode()).
  The load factor of 0.75 is optimal - it balances memory
   usage with performance by triggering resize before too
   many collisions occur.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Your Hash Map Implementation Analysis:

  1. Constructor (lines 2-7):

  - capacity = 16: Initial bucket array size (power of 2
  is common)
  - load_factor = 0.75: Resize when 75% full to avoid too
   many collisions
  - buckets: The actual storage array
  - size: Number of key-value pairs stored

  2. Hash Function (lines 8-16):

  Your hash function uses the polynomial rolling hash:
  hashCode = (31 * hashCode + charCode) % capacity
  - Multiplies by prime number 31 for good distribution
  - Adds character code of each letter
  - Takes modulo to fit within bucket array size

  3. Missing Implementation:

  The set() method is incomplete, and other methods are
  empty. This is where collision handling would go!

  Let me show you how a complete hash map would handle
  collisions and demonstrate the concepts in action.
  Would you like me to complete your implementation using
   chaining (linked lists) for collision resolution?

  This will help you see how:
  - Keys get converted to indices
  - Collisions are handled when multiple keys hash to
  same bucket
  - The hash map automatically resizes when load factor
  is exceeded
  - All operations achieve O(1) average performance

  Shall we build this together?
